    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Tonybrin Ochieng, a passionate and creative web developer currently pursuing my degree in Information Technology. I specialize in front-end development and love building clean, user-friendly, and responsive websites.</p>
  
    <p>Over the past few years, I’ve developed a solid foundation in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, elegant designs and clean code.</p>
  
    <p>My journey into coding started with curiosity and a desire to build something from nothing. Since then, I've built various projects ranging from personal blogs to fully responsive web applications. I'm constantly learning and staying updated with the latest web technologies.</p>
    <p>In addition to coding, I enjoy design doing research on the latest Technology trends. I believe in the power of collaboration, continuous improvement, and lifelong learning.</p>
  
    <p>Currently, I’m looking for internship or freelance opportunities where I can contribute, grow my skills, and work on exciting web projects with passionate people.</p>
  
    <p>When I’m not at the computer, I’m probably gaming (Call of Duty Mobile is my go-to!), reading up on new tech trends, or enjoying some photography.</p>
